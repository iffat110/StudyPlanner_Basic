# Project: Study Planner

## Objective:
Develop a user-friendly Study Planner that assists individuals in creating a personalized study routine based on their preferences. The program will gather essential information from the user, such as their name, the number of subjects to study, daily study hours commitment, the quantity of subjects to study each day, study days per week, and days off.

## User Input:
1. User Name
2. Number of Subjects to Study
3. Daily Study Hours Commitment
4. Number of Subjects to Study Daily
5. Study Days per Week
6. Days Off (input as weekdays)
7. Key Features:

## Dynamic Scheduling:

- The program will generate a personalized study routine based on the user's inputs.
- Subjects will be randomly chosen and evenly distributed across study days.

## User Commitment Verification:

If the number of days off is equal to the specified daily study frequency, the program will verify the user's commitment to the schedule.
The user will be prompted to confirm their commitment, allowing them to either proceed or restart the scheduling process.

## Flexible Days Off Input:

Users can input days off as complete weekdays (e.g., Monday, Tuesday).

## Detailed Study Plan:

The program will output a detailed study plan, including designated study days, subjects to study each day, and allocated study hours for each subject.

## Interactive User Experience:

- Users will have the option to either continue with the generated schedule or make changes.
- If changes are desired, the program will guide the user through the rescheduling process.

## Result Export:

- Users can choose to either save the generated study plan or continue with adjustments.
- If the user decides to quit, the result will be saved as a CSV file for future reference.

## Implementation:
The program will be implemented in a user-friendly manner, utilizing prompts and feedback to guide the user through the scheduling process. Conditional statements will ensure that the user's inputs are validated and that the generated study plan aligns with their preferences.

## User Interaction Flow:

1. Gather user information.
2. Validate inputs and confirm commitment.
3. Generate a study plan based on user preferences.
4. Display the study plan with details.
5. Prompt user to continue, reschedule, or quit.
6. If rescheduling, repeat the process.

   
## Conclusion:
The Study Planner project aims to empower users in creating a structured study routine tailored to their needs. By incorporating user-friendly features and dynamic scheduling, the program seeks to enhance the overall learning experience.
